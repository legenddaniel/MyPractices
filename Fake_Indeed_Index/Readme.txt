This is my first attemp making a (kinda formal) webpage. Sorry for the possible bugs even though I have checked it OK. I also did some optimazation.

Features:
1. Indeed.ca index without sign-in.

2. Including almost all the features (full-screen/window mode layouts, styles, events and functions) of the real Indeed.ca index but might have a little bit differences, especially in IE/Edge. Some of them are identified in the page as comments when hovering on specific elements which are usually with underline/border.

3. I noticed that the real Indeed.ca may change their UI some times but slightly, and seems different devices might see different UIs at different time of visit.
