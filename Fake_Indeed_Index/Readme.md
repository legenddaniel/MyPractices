This is my first attemp making a (kinda formal) webpage. 

I promise all codes as well as icons were done on my own.

Features:
    
    1. Indeed.ca index without sign-in.

    2. Including almost all the features (full-screen/window mode layouts, styles, events and functions) of the real Indeed.ca index but might have a little bit differences, especially in IE/Edge. Some of them are identified in the page as comments when hovering on specific elements which are usually with an underline/border.

    3. Indeed.ca may change their UI some times but slightly, and seems different devices might see different UIs at different time of visit.

    4. Indeed made a different UI for mobile devices from common low-resolution screen/window display.

    5. In the real Indeed when the user submits info through the #findJobButton the values in the input boxes are saved and showing in the #popularSearchesArea as search history.

Thanks for your inspection and I am getting better on it.
